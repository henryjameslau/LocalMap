## Split data for each LA

  #Subset the data by MP
  tmp=subset(totalweeklyincome,LAD13code==name)
  #Create a new filename for each MP - the folder 'cut' should already exist
  fn=paste('/Library/WebServer/documents/Henry/Local income/cut/',gsub(' ','',name),sep='','.csv')
  #Save the CSV file containing separate expenses data for each MP
  write.csv(tmp,fn,row.names=FALSE)
